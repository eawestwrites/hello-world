# I Wish I Had Learned Coding Earlier
At age 7, I had a VTECH Precomputer 1000. I remember the book it came with and it had a bunch of BASIC prompts you typed to play simple games. 
I typed in those lines, and played a few games. But back then, it didn't spark my imagination. Instead, I learned how to type on it.
I still recall the prompts for the home row: a sad gal laffs as a glad lad has lass
Now that I think about it, it was hella misogynistic.
